# WeatherApp
The Weather App is a web application that provides real-time weather information for locations around the world. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it leverages the OpenWeather Map API to fetch and display weather data. The Weather App offers users a simple and intuitive interface to quickly check weather conditions for any desired location.

Key Features:

Location-Based Weather: Users can search for weather information by entering the name of a city or location. The app fetches data for the specified location and displays the current weather conditions.

Weather Details: The app provides detailed weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather conditions (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy).

Temperat Users have the option to switch between temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit) based on their preference.

Dynamic Backgrounds: The Weather App enhances user experience by changing the background image based on the weather conditions. For instance, a sunny day might display a clear sky background, while a rainy day may show a rainy scene.
